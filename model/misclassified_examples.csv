James Woods as the alcoholic farmer drives a huge beater with a rusted roof which is emblematic of the general disrepair of his farm. A lovingly tended lamb with maggots is the reverse emblem of something helpless, needy and cared for. The refrigerator is spoken to as a character, as if standing in for absent nurturing from Woods' self-centered wife. The couple have two kids who must come of age as their home is being torn apart around them and the parents pursue fantasies of ""better things"" offered by crook Randy Quaid. Henry Thomas as the son copes by holding on to the land and creating a poetic commentary, and the responses of his sister to the crisis become a powerful and surprising tribute to womanhood.",drama,cinema version sam shepard play set well midcentury james wood alcoholic farmer drive huge beater rusted roof emblematic general disrepair farm lovingly tended lamb maggot reverse emblem something helpless needy cared refrigerator spoken character standing absent nurturing wood selfcentered wife couple two kid must come age home torn apart around parent pursue fantasy better thing offered crook randy quaid henry thomas son cope holding land creating poetic commentary response sister crisis become powerful surprising tribute womanhood,0,0,0,0,0,0,short
